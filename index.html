          <p>
               I'm a huge fan of public art. I am especially in love with the use of an
               illuminated work of art as it provides an additional dance with the
               concepts of meaning, utilitarian use, and the experience provided to the
               viewer. There are so many wonderful things that art can provide to our
               communities.
